<h1>Python Workshop</h1>

<p>This workshop is designed as a whirlwind tour of some basic and advanced python features. It focuses on basic usage, but includes many quick overviews of more advanced concepts. It assumes some knowledge of general programming.</p>
<p>The workshop is run as a jupyter notebook so that code and markdown can cohabitate. There are two notebooks; one is a "completed" version with copious notes and comments. The other is a "presentation" version with most of the details left out. This allows the presenter to write code as they present, and listeners to take notes as they listen. Installation instructions:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Make sure python is set up on your system (https://www.python.org/) </li>
  <li> Download the two notebook files and remember where you saved them </li>
  <li> Set up jupyter lab by running pip install jupyterlab </li>
  <li> Launch Lab by runniny <code>jupyter lab</code> in the command line </li>
  <li> Open the files from Lab by navigating to their location in the Lab file explorer and double clicking them </li>
</ol>
<p> The workshop also includes a brief introduction to Paul Martin's PyU4V, developed at Dell EMC </p>
